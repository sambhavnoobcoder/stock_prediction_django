apparently there was a lag between audio and video , due to video compression for guidelines on github . so sorry about that ....

app features are:

*Sign up and login functionality for users.
*Option to choose between US or Indian market stocks.
*Ability to predict the price of one or multiple stocks.
*Selection of the algorithm for stock price prediction.
*Storage of user activity timestamps and results in a database.
*Display of prediction results in both tabular and line chart formats.
*Provision of at least two algorithms for stock prediction.
*Benchmarking of predictions against actual data for evaluation.
